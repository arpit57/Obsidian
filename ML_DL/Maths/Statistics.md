## Significance Level

_The probability of rejecting Ho when you shouldn't do._

## Power

_the likelihood of rejecting the null hypothesis when it should be rejected._

## Accuracy

_How close is your estimation to the true value?_

## Precision

_It is a quality measurement, how close will your two measurements be to each other._

## Statistical Inference

_Finding a conclusion from your data by using statistics._

## Type 1 Error

_It occurs when rejecting a null hypothesis but it should not have to be rejected._

## Type 2 Error

_It occurs when the null hypotheses should be rejected but you don't._

## T Distribution

_Comparing means while standard deviation is unknown._

## Degrees of Freedom

_Determines thickness of tails._

_As the degrees of freedom increase, the shape of the t-distribution approaches the normal distribution._

## Distribution

Suppose you roll a dice, and you draw a distribution according to its results.

So you get total 7 number %16.6 possibility.

However, total number of 12, is only %2.7 or 1/36.

## Pairwise Comparison

Statistical method to compare multiple means in pairs to define if they significantly differ from each other. Also known as Copeland’s Method.

## Bootstrapping

It is a statistical method, useful when your dataset is small, resamples a dataset to create enough simulation.

## Chi-square

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/403/1*dQacaiSj8vBikmuovgEp4A.png)


## Correlation

It describes how much both variables depend on each other.

For example when you change one, how much the other will change.

## Residual

That means the difference between your prediction to an actual value.

## Slope

Suppose your function is ;

Image by Author-Slope.

When

-   x = 1 your y = 13
-   x = 2 your y = 21

That means when you increase x 1, your y change 8.

Your **_Slope_** is 8 and the **_Intercept_** is 5.

In the following one, try to predict.

## Extrapolate

If you want to predict a value that is outside the range of your linear model.

[https://www.statology.org/interpolation-vs-extrapolation/](https://www.statology.org/interpolation-vs-extrapolation/)

## Interpolate

If you want to predict a value that is inside the range of your linear model.

## Linearity

If you could explain your data point with a straight line.

## Nearly Normal Residuals

When your residuals are distributed as a normal distribution.

## Constant Variability

After making a prediction and plotting how much your prediction is away from the actual number, the error of the data points should be in the range.

## Explanatory Variable

To predict y, we will use x’s, responsible variable = x

## Responsible Variable

The one that we want to predict, y.

## Collinearity

Correlation between explanatory variables.

## Parsimony

Simply; A simple model will perform better.

## Backward Elimination

When you make a prediction, select all explanatory variables, and observe the relations between explanatory variables and response variables. Drop one by one that has a lower impact on explaining responsible variables.

## Forward Selection

Start with zero variable, and add variable according to their relationship between responsible variable.

## Outliers

IF your data point is < from Q1 -1.5 x IQR &

> Q3 + 1.5 x IQR

Then it could be defined as an outlier.
