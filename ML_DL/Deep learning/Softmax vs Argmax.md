**Argmax** and **Softmax** are both operations commonly used in machine learning, particularly in classification problems. However, they serve different purposes and have different strengths and weaknesses.

1. **Argmax**:

**Purpose**: The Argmax function is an operation that finds the argument that gives the maximum value from a vector (or more generally, from a set of values). For example, if you have a vector of class probabilities, argmax will return the index of the highest probability.

**Pros**:

- Simplicity: The argmax operation is simple and computationally efficient. It just picks the highest value.
- Interpretability: The output is an integer, representing the index of the highest value. This makes it easy to use directly in classification problems.

**Cons**:

- Discrete: Argmax is a hard assignment. It will only select one class, and gives no indication of the confidence of that decision. This lack of nuance could be an issue if the model's decision is uncertain.
- Non-differentiable: Argmax is non-differentiable, which means it cannot be used directly in the loss function for training models using gradient-based methods.

2. **Softmax**:

**Purpose**: The Softmax function, on the other hand, is a function that turns a vector of K real values into a vector of K real values that sum to 1. The output values can be interpreted as probabilities, which makes it useful for multi-class classification problems.

**Pros**:

- Probabilistic Interpretation: The outputs of softmax can be interpreted as probabilities, which gives a measure of the model's confidence in each class.
- Differentiable: Softmax is differentiable, which means it can be used directly in the loss function for training models using gradient-based methods.

**Cons**:

- Computationally More Expensive: Softmax involves exponentiation and division operations, making it more computically expensive than argmax.
- Sensitivity to Large Inputs: Due to the nature of the exponentiation, softmax can be very sensitive to large input values. This can lead to numerical instability.

In summary, while Argmax is used to get the hard assignment of the class with the highest probability, Softmax is used to calculate the probability distribution over all classes. These methods are typically used together in multi-class classification problems, where the softmax function is used in the model to compute probabilities, and then the argmax function is used to make a final decision based on those probabilities.

### why is softmax differentiable but not argmax?

The differentiability of a function refers to its ability to have a derivative at all points in its domain. The derivative represents the slope of the tangent line at any given point, which is a measure of how the function changes as the input changes. Functions that have a well-defined derivative at all points are smooth and don't have abrupt changes, making them suitable for gradient-based optimization algorithms.

1. **Softmax**: Softmax is a differentiable function. The reason for this is that the softmax function is composed of basic mathematical operations like exponentiation and division, all of which are differentiable operations. Therefore, by applying the chain rule of differentiation, we can compute the derivative of the softmax function with respect to its inputs. This property is very useful in training neural networks because it allows us to compute gradients and update the parameters of the model using methods like gradient descent.
    
2. **Argmax**: Argmax, on the other hand, is not differentiable. The reason is that argmax is a function that returns the index of the maximum input value. The output of the argmax function changes abruptly as the input changes, which means it has points of discontinuity where the derivative does not exist. For example, if the input to the argmax function is a vector of values, and two or more of these values are very close together and keep changing with each iteration, the output of the argmax function will jump between the indices of these values. This makes the function non-differentiable at those points.
    

This property of argmax makes it unsuitable for use directly in the loss function during the training of models that use gradient-based optimization methods. It's typically used after the model is trained to make a final decision based on the output probabilities.

### how does the derivate from softmax help in backpropagation?

The backpropagation algorithm in neural networks relies on derivatives to compute gradients, which are then used to update the model's parameters (weights and biases) during training. The goal is to minimize the loss function, which measures the difference between the model's predictions and the actual target values.

Let's consider a neural network that uses the softmax function in its output layer for multi-class classification. When a prediction is made, the softmax function generates a probability distribution over the classes. This distribution is then compared to the target distribution (usually a one-hot encoded vector for the correct class), and a loss is computed, such as the cross-entropy loss.

In order to minimize this loss, we need to adjust the weights and biases of the model. To do so, we need to know the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter. This is where the derivative of the softmax function comes in.

The derivative of the softmax function is used to calculate how a small change in the input to the softmax function would affect the output, and consequently, the loss. This is computed for each neuron in the output layer and then propagated back through the network to adjust the parameters.

More specifically, during backpropagation, the derivative of the loss function with respect to the output of the softmax function is computed first. Then, the chain rule of differentiation is used to compute the derivative of the loss with respect to the input of the softmax function. This is done by multiplying the previously computed derivative by the derivative of the softmax function.

The result gives us the rate of change of the loss with respect to the input to the softmax function. This information is then used to adjust the weights and biases that produced this input in the first place, with the goal of decreasing the loss. This process is repeated for all layers in the network, propagating the error from the output layer back to the input layer, hence the name "backpropagation".

So in summary, the derivative of the softmax function is crucial for the backpropagation process as it allows us to compute the gradients needed to adjust the model's parameters and improve its predictions.
