## Reinforcement Learning:

- Definition: Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that sits somewhat in between supervised and unsupervised learning. An agent learns to make decisions and take actions in an environment to maximize a reward signal.
- Key Components:
    - Agent: The learning entity that takes actions and makes decisions.
    - Environment: The world or context in which the agent operates and interacts.
    - State: The current situation or condition of the environment.

    - Reward: The feedback signal that indicates the desirability of the action taken by the agent.
    - Policy: The strategy or mapping that determines the agent's actions based on the current state.
- Reinforcement Learning Process:
    1. The agent observes the current state of the environment.
    2. The agent takes an action based on its policy.
    3. The environment transitions to a new state based on the action taken.
    4. The agent receives a reward or penalty from the environment.
    5. The agent updates its policy based on the received reward to maximize future rewards.

    - θj(t+1) is the updated value of parameter θj at iteration t+1.
    - α is the learning rate.
    - ∂J(θ) / ∂θj is the partial derivative of the cost function with respect to the parameter θj.

## Decision Trees:

- Definition: Decision Trees are a popular supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. They are tree-structured models where each internal node represents a feature (attribute), each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents an outcome or class label.
- Key Terms:
    - Node: A point in the tree where a decision is made based on a feature.
    - Root Node: The topmost node in the tree, representing the entire dataset.

- Algorithm:
    1. Start with the entire dataset at the root node.
    2. Select the best feature to split the data based on the chosen splitting criterion.
    3. Create a new internal node for the selected feature and branch out based on the feature's values.
    4. Recursively repeat steps 2-3 for each child node until a stopping criterion is met.
    5. Assign the majority class (for classification) or the average value (for regression) to each leaf node.
    6. Optionally, prune the tree to remove branches that may lead to overfitting.
- Pros:
    - Easy to understand and interpret, as the decision rules are visible in the tree structure.

    1. Standardize the data by subtracting the mean and scaling to unit variance.
    2. Compute the covariance matrix of the standardized data.
    3. Perform eigen decomposition on the covariance matrix to obtain eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
