### Overview

K-means clustering is an unsupervised ML algorithm that can partition unlabeled data into K clusters.

1. **Initialization**: K initial cluster centers (not data points) are chosen randomly from the data or by using methods like K-means++. The remaining data points are not labeled at this point.
    
2. **Assignment**: Each data point is assigned to the cluster whose center is nearest to it, thus forming K clusters.
    
3. **Update**: The initially chosen cluster centers are recalculated as the centroid of each cluster, which is the mean of all the data points in that cluster.
    
4. **Repeat**: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until no noticeable changes are observed in the cluster assignments or the centroids.
    
5. **Determination of K**: The value of K can be determined using methods like the Elbow Method, where the Sum of Squared Residuals (SSR) is plotted on the y-axis and K on the x-axis. The "elbow" of the plot is the point where the SSR value does not drop significantly, indicating a suitable value for K.
### Pros:

1. **Simplicity**: It's easy to implement and understand.
2. **Efficiency**: It's computationally faster compared to some other clustering methods, especially for large datasets.
3. **Scalability**: It can be used for large datasets.

### Cons:

1. **Sensitivity to Initial Centroids**: The final clusters depend on the initial random selection of centroids, which might lead to suboptimal solutions.
2. **Assumption of Spherical Clusters**: K-means assumes that clusters are spherical, which might not be suitable for data with complex shapes.
3. **Dependence on K**: You must specify the number of clusters (K) beforehand, and it may not always be easy to determine the best value.
4. **Prone to Local Minima**: The algorithm may converge to a local minimum, depending on the initialization of centroids.

### Assumptions:

1. **Clusters are Spherical**: The algorithm assumes that clusters are spherical and equally sized, so it may perform poorly with elongated or irregularly shaped clusters.
2. **Clusters are of Similar Density**: The algorithm assumes that the clusters have a similar number of data points, which might not be true in real-world data.
3. **Independence of Features**: The algorithm treats each feature as independent, which might not capture complex relationships between features.
4. **Scale Sensitivity**: The results can be sensitive to the scaling of the data, as it uses the Euclidean distance between data points.
