### Middleware

**Middleware** is a function or a set of functions that runs between the server receiving a request and sending a response. Middleware functions can execute any code, make changes to the request and the outgoing response, end the request-response cycle, and call the next middleware function in the stack.

#### Why use middleware?

- **Session Management**: Handling user sessions, such as login states or user-specific data storage.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Checking if a user is logged in and if they have permission to access certain routes or resources.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Recording data about requests and responses for debugging or analysis.
- **Data Processing**: Modifying request data before it reaches the application logic, like parsing cookies or formatting incoming data.

#### How it works

Middleware functions are typically defined in a sequence within the application's request-handling pipeline. Each middleware can either pass the request to the next middleware or complete the request-response cycle. This allows you to layer your application with various functionalities that process the HTTP requests and responses systematically.

### WebSockets

**WebSockets** provide a way to open an interactive communication session between a user's browser and a server. With WebSockets, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.

#### Why use WebSockets?

- **Real-Time Data**: Ideal for applications that require real-time data flow, such as live chat applications, real-time notifications, and online gaming.
- **Efficient Communication**: Reduces the overhead of HTTP connections by maintaining a persistent connection where both parties can start sending data at any time.

#### How they work

The WebSocket protocol facilitates continuous data exchange between client and server after a WebSocket connection is established over a single, long-lived connection. It starts with a handshake via HTTP, upgrading the connection to a WebSocket connection which then remains open for real-time, bi-directional communication.

### Webhooks

**Webhooks** are user-defined HTTP callbacks that are triggered by specific events in a server or third-party service. When the triggering event occurs, the source site makes an HTTP request to the URL configured for the webhook. This makes webhooks a powerful tool for integrating and extending different systems.

#### Why use Webhooks?

- **Automated Notifications**: Webhooks provide a way to send real-time data from one application to another whenever a given event occurs.
- **Efficiency**: Unlike APIs that require polling to check for updates, webhooks deliver data as it happens, significantly reducing latency and load on the server.
- **Custom Integrations**: They enable custom integration scenarios where an application can automatically trigger actions or notifications in other systems without user intervention.

#### How they work

Webhooks are usually configured via an application's settings where you specify a URL for the webhook to post data to. When the specified event occurs, the application sends a HTTP POST request to the configured URL, containing information about the event in the request body. The receiving server can then process this data and act upon it accordingly.

- **Setup**: You define webhooks in your application settings, specifying the URL to receive the data and what events should trigger the sending of data.
- **Triggering Events**: When the specified event happens, the application makes an HTTP request (usually POST) to the URL set up for the webhook.
- **Data Handling**: The server at the URL processes the incoming data, which could involve updating a database, sending notifications, or any other actions triggered by the event.

Webhooks are a simple yet highly effective way to enable server-to-server communication in response to events, making them an essential tool in modern web development, especially in creating reactive, interconnected systems.
