In FastAPI, you can pass parameters to a path function in several ways, depending on the nature of the data and how it should be received by the server. Here are the primary methods you can use:

1. **Path Parameters**:
    
    - These are part of the URL path and are essential for the URL to be valid. They are typically used to identify a specific resource.
    - Example:
        
```python
        from fastapi import FastAPI

		app = FastAPI()
		
		@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
		def read_item(item_id: int):
		    return {"item_id": item_id}
```

        
2. **Query Parameters**:
    
    - These are optional most of the time and are added after the `?` in the URL. They are great for optional modifications to the behavior of the endpoint.
    - Example:

		```python
		@app.get("/items/")
		def read_items(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10):
		    return {"skip": skip, "limit": limit}
```

3. **Request Body Parameters**:
    
    - This involves sending data through the request body, often using formats like JSON. This is useful for sending complex and/or large amounts of data.
    - Example:

		```python
		from pydantic import BaseModel

		class Item(BaseModel):
		    name: str
		    description: str = None
		    price: float
		    tax: float = None
		
		@app.post("/items/")
		def create_item(item: Item):
		    return {"name": item.name, "price": item.price}
```


        
4. **Form Data**:
    
    - Similar to request body parameters, but used to send data as form fields.
    - Example:
        
```python
		from fastapi import Form

		@app.post("/login/")
		def login(username: str = Form(...), password: str = Form(...)):
		    return {"username": username}
```

        
5. **Header Parameters**:
    
    - These parameters are included in the HTTP header of the request. They are typically used for metadata or authorization.
    - Example:

```python
		from fastapi import Header

		@app.get("/items/")
		def read_items(user_agent: str = Header(None)):
		    return {"User-Agent": user_agent}
```


        
6. **Cookie Parameters**:
    
    - Parameters stored in cookies can be accessed directly in FastAPI.
    - Example:

```python
		from fastapi import Cookie

		@app.get("/items/")
		def read_items(ads_id: str = Cookie(None)):
		    return {"Ads-ID": ads_id}
```



Each of these methods serves different purposes and can be used in various combinations depending on the specific requirements of your API.
